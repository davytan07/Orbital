## Synopsis
Necro Undead Survival is a 3D FPS survival shooter created with Unity. You play as a student who finds themselves trapped in the National University of Singapore, which has been overrun by monstrous creatures known as the deCAPitators, who will do whatever it takes to stop you from achieving your goal. The deCAPitators are monstrous manifestations of the many obstacles that students commonly face.

## Design
Maps were created using RenderDocs https://renderdoc.org/builds, a tool used to capture Google Maps 3D data for import into Blender followed by Unity. Free assets for cars, guns, enemies and barriers were used for the game design.
